# fire_fatalities
A machine learning approach to profiling fire-related incidents where a fatality is most likely to occur.

This project uses data available from the UK government's fire statistics catalogue: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fire-statistics-incident-level-datasets. In particular, the "casualties in fires" dataset and "fire-related fatalities" dataset.

If following my R code, run casualties_clean.R before casualties.R and fatalities_clean.R before fatalities.R
